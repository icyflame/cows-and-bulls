# Cows and Bulls: The Game

Learn more about this game on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_cows)

This is a Python implementation of the game. It is a one player game, with the computer
guessing and storing a number.

The user must enter guesses, and depending on the feedback given by the computer (regarding 
the number of bulls and cows in the guess), the user must hone his guesses, and finally move
towards the number that the computer has guessed.

This implementation uses Python, and Tkinter for the GUI framework.
